            <p>I recently completed an internship at <a class="link link--inline" href="https://www.simb.co/">SimB &amp; Company</a>. While there I worked on a Symfony based application for a Portland-area business. I wrote PHP code to implement the functionality of the application, created unit tests, wrote JavaScript to add client side visualizations and input validation, and styled the application to match mock-ups.</p>
